# OpenGLRenderer
This is a custom OpenGL renderer I originally made as part of a class at Digipen
Demos Available on https://www.markkouris.com/ under the OpenGL renderer segment. The links to the youtube demos can also be found below:

### notes:
I plan to continually expand this project to allow more versatility and to allow for more use cases.
Some Bugs currently exist in the project, most notible the lighting sources that orbit the main object do not show up, even though they are used for lighting calculations. 
Eventually, once the project is finished, I will upload the full working source here.
If you would like to know more, please feel free to reach out!
