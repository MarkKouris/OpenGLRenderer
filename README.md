# OpenGLRenderer
This is a custom OpenGL renderer I originally made as part of a class at Digipen
Demos Available on https://www.markkouris.com/ under the OpenGL renderer segment. The links to the youtube demos can also be found below: <br />

### notes:
I plan to continually expand this project to allow more versatility and to allow for more use cases. <br />
Some Bugs currently exist in the project, most notible the lighting sources that orbit the main object do not show up, even though they are used for lighting calculations. <br />
Eventually, once the project is finished, I will upload the full working source here. <br />
If you would like to know more, please feel free to reach out! <br />
