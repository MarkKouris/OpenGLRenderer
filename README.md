# OpenGLRenderer
This is a custom OpenGL renderer I originally made as part of a class at Digipen
I plan to continually expand this project to allow more versatility and to allow for more use cases.

Some Bugs currently exist in the project, most notible the lighting sources that orbit the main object do not show up, even though they are used for lighting calculations. 

To view a demo, visit my website and view the project labeled CS 300/350.
